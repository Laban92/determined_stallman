## GASP

 State of the art health monitoring algorithm

## Summary Paragraph

Modern smart watches and fitness bands can only give us a rough estimates of certain health metrics. How many calories you spend is usually approximated using your age, weight, sex, and accelerometer data, And even state of the art sleep tracking technologies like Huawei TruSleep can only make wild estimates of the duration of person's sleeping cycles . Gasp is the first available algorithm which is capable of calculating calories spent, basal metabolic rate, and sleeping cycle duration based on respiratory rate tracking.
